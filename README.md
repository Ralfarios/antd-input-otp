## Demo 🧪

- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/antd-input-otp-demo-1jmypp)

## Prerequisite ⭐

- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) >= 4.19.1
- [React](https://react.dev) >= 16.8.0

## Install 💻

### npm

> npm install antd-input-otp

### yarn

> yarn add antd-input-otp

## How to use 🪴

Simply import like other antd's components as usual and call it. You can use it uncontrolled with `Form` from [Ant Design Form](https://ant.design/components/form) or use it controlled with React useState.

Keep in mind this component will return undefined or array of string.

### Uncontrolled

```jsx
import { Button, Form } from 'antd';
import { InputOTP } from 'antd-input-otp'; // Don't forget to import this too!

const InputOTPPage = () => {
  const [form] = Form.useForm();

  const handleFinish = (values) => {
    // Your logic
  };

  return (
    <Form onFinish={handleFinish} form={form}>
      <Form.Item label="OTP" name="otp">
        <InputOTP autoSubmit={form} inputType="numeric" />
      </Form.Item>

      <Form.Item>
        <Button htmlType="submit">Submit</Button>
      </Form.Item>
    </Form>
  );
};
```

### Controlled

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { Button } from 'antd';
import { InputOTP } from 'antd-input-otp'; // Don't forget to import this too!

const InputOTPPage = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState([]); // Since the value will be array of string, the default value of state is empty array.

  const handleFinish = (otp) => {
    const payload = otp || value; // Since useState work asynchronously, we shall add the field value from the autoSubmit.
    // Your logic with state
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <InputOTP onChange={setValue} value={value} autoSubmit={handleFinish} />

      <Button onClick={() => handleFinish()}>Submit</Button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Props 🥠

Keep in mind, the props will be extended to antd `InputProps`, which means properties that are not listed below can be seen on [Ant Design Input](https://ant.design/components/input).

## FAQ ❓

### Q: (NEW) When I use `autoSubmit` on controlled field, why my value always late 1 step?

A: You see, React useState works asynchronously, so when autoSubmit is triggered, the setState is not running yet. The solution so far is by using the value from the argument of the functions. You can see this in the example above.

### Q: (NEW) I am using Webpack / `create-react-app`, why I always get an error `Failed to parse source map from...`?

A: To be honest, I am not quite sure about this, but the solution for now is to add this line of code inside your `.env` file.

```
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### Q: Can I paste the OTP to this component?

A: YES! But you should update it to v1.1.0 first. Keep in mind, the value that you copy should be suitable with your inputType, for example if you have `030212` in your clipboard, and your inputType is `numeric`, it will work. But it will be a different story when your value is `A023@c!`, it won't work.

### Q: What will this component return?

A: This component will return an array of strings if erased or already filled, or undefined if this component remains untouched.

### Q: Can I use it on Ant Design Form?

A: Ofcourse, the best part is you don't need to setup anything. Just write and go!

### Q: Ant Design Form is not my cup of tea, can I use it with useState instead?

A: You bet! Use it like other input with onChange and value.

### Q: So I'm using Ant Design Form and I want to add an error below it, but it's ugly. How to fix it?

A: Interesting, first of all, add a class on your InputOTP's Form.Item. then add `text-align: center` on `.ant-form-item .ant-form-item-explain-error`.

If you are using antd v5, be sure to wrap `.ant-form-item` with `:where()`, so it will become like this..

```scss
.your-classname:where(.ant-form-item) .ant-form-item-explain-error {
  text-align: center;
}
```

## Become a Contributor! ✨

Sometimes, I face an issue that too long to fix because I need to learn the best way to solve it so this package will run flawlessly in your project. However, it would be great if you could help me by contributing to this project.

1. Clone this repo and then check out the `development` branch by using

   > `git checkout development`.

2. I want to keep this repo clean and tracked, so please create a new branch from the development branch to get on your work.
   The convention is `<flag>/<name-of-your-branch>`. Here's the table for the flag.

| Flag     | Description                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| feat     | A new Feature                                             |
| fix      | For Bugfix or Hotfix                                      |
| test     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests         |
| chore    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files         |
| refactor | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| revert   | Reverts a previous commit                                 |
| docs     | documentation only changes                                |

for example: `feat/adding-cool-feature`.

3. After you are done, create a pull request and add me as your review. You can merge it after I approve it.

And that's it. Or, if you have a bug to report but don't know how to fix it, just tell me on the GitHub issue. I'll happily answer.
